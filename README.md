# Draekz ComfyUI Ultimate Installer

_NOTE: I have no relation or connection to the ComfyUI team. This is a personal quality of life project that i use to install and manage ComfyUI installations, and I share it with others._

This installer aims to allow the installation of ComfyUI for NVIDIA on Windows (including Sage Attention, Triton Windows, xFormers) and all the accelerations enabled out of the box. It supports installing commonly used nodes, as well as multiple levels of quality of all the best models available today.

**It currently supports: SD1.5, SDXL, SD3.5, HiDream, Flux Dev, Flux Schnell, Flux Kontext, Qwen Image, Qwen Image Edit, WAN 2.1/2.2 (Including FusionX and Vace)** and it attempts to let you choose your VRAM levels to install the appropriate models for the best quality for your hardware. It also installs all related models one would need for a variety of tasks. It leverages Huggingface to download all of the models, and github to download all of the nodes.

My nodes and workflows are also automatically included from these projects:

I use the installation of ComfyUI 0.3.49 then automatically upgrades from there. The installer ensures a Python 3.12 environment and a full compatibility with all the nodes I install. It adds customizations to the initial ComfyUI configuration, as well as convenient launchers for the client and server. The Server Manager and Client Wrapper projects are also installed automatically if requested in the install process, and provide an easy-to-use set of windows applications to use ComfyUI. Either way, we will add shortcuts to access ComfyUI client and server whether you use the manager and wrapper or not.

Once the base ComfyUI installation is complete, you can re-use the installer to add models easily without having to re-download or re-install parts that were already installed before.

The project was written entirely using Gemini 2.5 Pro.
